Players expect the changes in nightly to be unpolished and experimental, but they also view those changes as set and decided for the beta release. Features that make it to the nightly branch are perceived as the entire development team‚Äôs final decision, so much that word of those features often extends beyond the testing community and sometimes even beyond the HDR community entirely.When we released our first beta and became open-source, the nightly branch replaced private/internal testing of changes. The nightly branch was intended to be a place where any change can be tried, tested, adjusted, and even reverted. We expected relatively few players to go out of their way to play a build so volatile, and we never expected tournaments and brand new players to play on nightly.Development changes and beta pre-releasesGoing forward, we will be making changes to the development process to attempt to meet the players‚Äô expectations, and to create better developer tools.Instead of the nightly build, we will begin releasing periodic beta pre-release builds. This will be a new kind of build that‚Äôs more in-line with the players current expectations for nightly. It will be an opt-in early access build where players can test beta-ready changes and find issues in polish and balance. We will use feedback from large-scale testing to make adjustments and post subsequent pre-releases, until we‚Äôre finally happy with the changes and ready for a full beta release.To accompany beta pre-release builds, development-team changes will become private until each pre-release. We want to give our developers the confidence to work on proof-of-concept features, test contentious character changes, and polish their work over longer periods of time before introducing them to the whole community. We also want to remove the current feeling of ‚Äúcharacter ownership‚Äù that‚Äôs pervasive in players and developers alike. The changes that eventually make it to beta pre-release builds will be those that the development team has collectively viewed, tested, and decided on.The futureWe understand that these are big changes that could be worrying to dedicated players and testers. To be clear, this does not signify the end of community contributions, or our status as an open source project. Beta releases and our codebase still are, and always will be, fully viewable on GitHub. Pull requests can still be opened by anyone and reviewed by the dev team as normal. Any approved PRs will be brought over to the private development branch and treated like any other change.We‚Äôre truly privileged to witness our project grow and amass the following it has today. We‚Äôre also privileged to create something with such a heavy emphasis on open community involvement and discussion throughout development. The development team is confident in these changes to our workflow, and we hope you‚Äôll continue to help us make the best game we can.The HDR Development Team" }, { "title": "Landing Lag and the State of the Game", "url": "/posts/landing-lag-postmortem/", "categories": "ProjectInformation", "tags": "", "date": "2024-06-13 16:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "We‚Äôd like to make a public statement regarding a recent change that made it‚Äôs way into nightly, the way the community reacted, and the developer response.The Brief (TL;DR)While we would appreciate ...", "content": "We‚Äôd like to make a public statement regarding a recent change that made it‚Äôs way into nightly, the way the community reacted, and the developer response.The Brief (TL;DR)While we would appreciate you reading the entirety of this post for some insights into developer thought processes, here is a TL;DR of what is happening: The landing lag changes as a whole are being reverted (the parry and shield changes which were included in the initial patch will continue to stay in the game and receive support and iteration) Organizational changes will be made to both the dev team internally and to the HewDraw Remix public discord server to make presenting feedback more straightforward and streamlined.The Changes and the IntentionThe changes in question were a cast-wide change to landing lag. On-average, characters‚Äô aerials‚Äô landing lag had been increased by 2 frames and some change, with some characters receiving a lighter set of landing lag changes and other characters being hit a little bit harder.We understood the change that this would have on the way that the game would feel and how characters would play, and it was intentional. Unfortunately, these changes combined with defense buffs and resulted in a swing towards defensive play that was too strong for a game that has historically prioritized offense and movement.We want to be explicit and clear: We knew what these changes would do, we went forward with the change, it was not a guess. We knew that it would drastically upset the state of the game, and that it would shake things up a lot. However, we can see clearly now that the resulting impact on the game was not desirable to us or to our playerbase.We will be fully reverting all of the landing lag changes as well as the accompanying shield stun changes that were applied to compensate for that landing lag.Discord Server ChangesOur official Discord server has been through many iterations, ranging from a wild house when we were a game in our initial alpha stages to a (allegedly) more organized server now where social and development conversations can stay separated.In it‚Äôs current form, the Discord server has a few public channels which have become problematic for interactions between developers and HDR players, these channels are: #meta-general #balance-discussion #dev-generalWhile these channels were created with good intentions when we launched beta in March of 2022, the game and community have grown beyond what we could have anticipated back then, and the purpose of these channels has been muddied and the usage of them has become problematic.Moving forward, these three channels are going to be publicly archived in a new Archived channel category at the bottom of the server.These channels will be replaced in both form and purpose with a new forum channel called game-feedback. This channel will be open to all players, but read-only for the developement team: ‚Äú‚ùå Declined/Not Doing‚Äù: The change is not going to be implemented. The forum post will stay open once this label has been applied by a moderator in case changes happen. ‚Äúüìù Considering‚Äù: The change is being considered by the developers, but there is no promise on whether or not it will make it‚Äôs way into the game. ‚Äúüîç Researching Options‚Äù: The problem is understood and identified, and we are researching options to address it that may or may not align with proposed solutions if they were provided. ‚Äú‚úÖ Planned‚Äù: The change is planned. There is no guarantee whether the change will make it into the next nightly cycle or beta, just that it is planned on has the attention of the developers.In ConclusionThese landing lag changes are going to be fully reverted. We have seen what the other side of this game can look like, there are some things that we liked and a lot that we didn‚Äôt. As we continue to work on the game we hope that you trust us to make the right decision and hope that you will continue to support us in our venture on this project with our new and expanded understanding of our role as a team and the game we are building.We ask that you do not harass, dehumanize, or otherwise talk down to the developers that have poured their heart and soul into this game for years and continue to do so. We are all extremely passionate people and players just like you trying to create a game that we all love to play.

In case you also missed it, there is now an @testing role which you can go get in #welcome channel in the discord to be informed when contributors or devs really need something specific tested. Read on to learn how to contribute to the project, whether a little or a lot, by testing early builds and helping us find issues before they make their way into betas.Testing Guide (Mad Villain)Greetings fellow humans, my tag is Mad Villain and I‚Äôm the self appointed lead playtester for HDR. If you‚Äôre like me and enjoy labbing upcoming changes or wish to contribute to playtesting new characters, features, or engine changes, you‚Äôve come to the right spot. I‚Äôll be providing you with a general outline on how you can setup your switch console for playtesting potential changes to HDR.Why is testing needed in the first place?As with any new project, the appearance of bugs and other oddities is unavoidable. These issues can end up ruining the user experience or in worse cases, cause a game crash. Hence, it‚Äôs imperative to try to resolve any issues before patch updates occur. As HDR is still in beta, play testing is an essential tool for our developers to have to stamp out any unforeseen problems. Not only does playtesting serve as a tool for weeding out bugs, but it‚Äôs immensely helpful for developers to have user feedback on possible engine/character changes as well as it helps in deciding what may or may not be implemented. With that out of the way, we‚Äôll move on to the most important form of testing‚Ä¶NightliesTypically once a day (or every few days), when changes get merged, a nightly update is built and uploaded to HDR‚Äôs github repository. This patch is known as a ‚ÄúNightly‚Äù and contains the most recently approved changes to the base game of HDR. It is within this patch that most testing should occur.The simplest way to test out a nightly is by updating to it from the HDR launcher page. Follow this visual guide through the process:Nightly Installation Image GuideAnd with that, you should be able to test out the newest experimental builds.How should you test?Mainly, the best form of testing is to simply play the game. Playing it with another person offline/online or even against CPUs can help you find any oddities that may occur as a result of the newest changes. Most changes in the patch will come in the form of system or character alterations so directly playing with them is the most effective method of testing. Take note of anything that doesn‚Äôt seem to function as intended, especially if it causes some sort of crash to the game. You can also give feedback on the changes, including voicing any concerns with system or character changes. You can report your findings/feedback on the Issues page on Github.To make it easier for the developers to sift through your issues, please use the following format in the title header:[Nightly ver. XX.XX] Character/System Change - General Description of IssueFor example, if you‚Äôd like to report an issue about wavelanding it would be written as:[Nightly ver. 06.35] Waveland ECB Change - Certain characters can't waveland properly on these stages(In the comment area, please provide specific details of the issue and provide image/video links if possible)Once you‚Äôre done writing out the issue, click on the submit issue button.And that‚Äôs it! If you have any other questions in regards to nightly testing feel free to post ask in the #testing channel in the server.(If you want to switch back to the public beta build, go back to the launcher page and click on ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù and then choose ‚ÄúSwitch to Beta‚Äù)Advanced Testing GuideWhile testing the nightly patch is the most recommended form of testing, some users can opt to test individual changes instead. You can do so by adding files from a Pull Request (which I will abbreviate as PR). A PR is a type of submission done by developers that is ‚Äúrequesting‚Äù the permission of other developers to be approved and added to the Nightly. That is to say, the changes done in a nightly patch is simply a culmination of PRs . The PRs normally aim to change one particular aspect of HDR such as stage parameters, cameras, UI, and character balancing, among many others. Reviewing PRs made by the developers can help them iron out any kinks within their changes before it is approved and reaches the nightly build. If you‚Äôre interested in testing PRs please follow the instructions below.First begin by going to the Pull Requests page. This page contains all the pull requests that are available for review by other developers and testers. From here you can choose any of the PRs you would like to test out. For this example, we‚Äôll take a look at the Dr. Mario Changes PR. The following guide will demonstrate how to test this change.Sample PR Change Image GuideJust like playtesting the nightly patch, the developers appreciate any feedback on the changes they are working on. You can leave that feedback by writing a comment on the individual PR‚Äôs page by scrolling towards the bottom of the page.It can also be helpful to look at the Issues page. Most PRs should include a link to an issue - they will say something like Fixes #234, which indicates that this PR is meant to address that linked issue. Sometimes the useful discription for a PR is not on the PR itself, but rather in a linked issue. Keep this in mind.Elaboration from techy: We actually *REALLY appreciate having pull request builds tested before they get merged. In the past, though rare, we have merged things into the nightly which were not tested by someone other than the developer, and the result was a lot of headache (by me or blujay) to go back and figure out at what point the crash started. If we had more nightly players, this may have been caught sooner, but the biggest impact on this is people taking a moment to play a PR build and say ‚Äúyep, it doesn‚Äôt crash, and it seems to function more or less as written.‚Äù Even just this kind of very basic feedback is priceless.*#Training Mode VisualizerOne of our esteemed developers (blujay) has created an experimental hitbox/hurtbox visualizer for HDR, which can be very helpful while testing. If you‚Äôd like to use it alongside your testing, here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to install it.First download the visualizer from the following link:Visualizer download linkAfter extracting the file, follow the instructions on the link below:HDR Visualizer Installation Image Guide#ROMFS Changes (super advanced testing)In some of the PRs created by the developers, their is a possibility that they require downloading extra files other than the ‚Äúhdr-switch‚Äù file. The file being referred to here is known as ROMFS. The developer will indicate if this file is necessary in their description of the PR. Please note that this isn‚Äôt necessary for most changes and only do this step when it is explicitly written on the PR description.To get this file you‚Äôll have to go to the page containing in-development romfs releases. Download the latest ROMFS file available by clicking on ‚Äúromfs.zip‚Äù Extract the files inside the ROMFS Zip Click on the ultimate folder and rename the hdr-assets and hdr-stages folders to hdr-pr-assets and hdr-pr-stages Drag the ultimate folder to the root of your SD card Open the mod manager and make sure to disable the hdr-assets and hdr stages, and enable hdr-pr-assets and hdr-pr-stagesIf you are not careful, and do not follow the above steps, you may ‚Äúbreak‚Äù your installation according to the launcher. Follow the steps above closely if you plan on testing romfs changes.(Note: You can switch back to base HDR by reenabling hdr-assets and hdr-stages and disabling the hdr-pr-assets and hdr-pr-stages on the mod manager)And thats it!There are a lot of ways people can help out testing, and we hope that with this guide and the newly available @testing role, more people will get involved!" }, { "title": "HewDraw Remix's Third Public Beta - Balance Considerations", "url": "/posts/third-beta/", "categories": "Release, ProjectInformation", "tags": "release", "date": "2022-04-03 14:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "WelcomeHey guys, today we have another public beta release!

There are a large number of changes (its been almost a month since our last content update), so to look at the Releases page to see the full changelog! Among other things, there is: Major Quality of Life improvements for the launcher Somewhat major changes to global engine mechanics Targed changes/reworks for a few charactersThis time around however, the developer blog is primarily an update on the status of our balance and design, by Black Calculus. Read on to see! But first‚Ä¶Developer blog (Black Calculus)As you all may (or may not) know, HDR started as a fun project for me to mess around with my friends in a Melee-like engine with Ult‚Äôs cast. The entire goal of HDR was for me to blend what I liked best from Melee, Ult, PM, and other fighters/platform fighters I‚Äôve played into a fun explosive experience.This scope has been constantly changing ever since I agreed to form a dev team with Gryz and now that we‚Äôve released publicly the project is basically out of my hands and my original vision scope wise.Now while that‚Äôs not a terrible thing there are a few things I need to note:This game is BIG.Most of the extremely stupid busted tear your hair out stuff (or things that are even just mildly broken) has come from there being 90 characters in this game and me overcompensating with crazy attributes on moves to give characters tools to deal with most matchups reliably since for the longest time it was just me making those changes. As stated before I was prioritizing making characters fun over making them balanced and part of that was giving them crazy attributes on moves, frame data, gimmicks, etc., which led to an overall more exciting and fun experience than my pitiful attempt at balancing early on. It‚Äôs easier to balance a cast like this without having the time to meticulously tune every single thing about this giant mosh pit of a roster by giving everyone very potent options so that everyone can contend on a similar level at the very least in advantage so that once you land a hit you‚Äôre able to swing the game back in your favor with good play, or to make it easier to land a hit in the first place. Clearly though this is a product of times past and now that we‚Äôre trying to present ourselves as more of a solid experience the more egregious stuff needs to be let go or tuned down to an actually reasonable level. Additionally, some characters have clearly gotten more love and attention than others, again tying back to the time when it was just me making changes to 90 characters. I‚Äôm sure you all don‚Äôt have an idea of the amount of time and energy that takes even for a single character, but let me tell you it is mind rending. We‚Äôve accrued more experience and knowledge as a dev team over the past few years and now that we‚Äôve come to the point we‚Äôre at we‚Äôre able to identify what needs to be addressed now that we‚Äôve settled in to a more consistent rhythm, the mod itself is closer to where we want it to be than it ever was before, and we have a more clear idea of the direction we want to take the game which has been an endeavor we‚Äôve been continually iterating over and striving towards over the past three years. The game engine and making sure characters feel good within it has been top priority since if those two things aren‚Äôt achieved then there‚Äôs no business going through and making more meticulous tweaks to something that‚Äôs not fun. Obviously we‚Äôre not infallible in that aspect, but we‚Äôve been going through and starting to readjust as appropriate recently. Keep in mind that this is an iterative process. We‚Äôre not going to get everything perfect the first time around.This project is not complete, and you shouldn‚Äôt treat is as such.As far as the new tools/mechanics that I‚Äôve been giving characters or that they have been given, it‚Äôs a mixed bag as to how well they work or the reasoning behind them.Some of them like Bayo‚Äôs cancels were to preserve the spirit of the character and allow them to retain a similar playstyle while being able to compensate for the engine changes in HDR with good enough execution/smart play. Others were to make an otherwise absolutely boring tool on a white bread kit actually interesting to use as in the case with Palutena reflector.One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that when I have time to balance something new that‚Äôs added appropriately before it reaches the public people seem to be much more accepting of it than if it reaches a build in a state that I either wasn‚Äôt happy with or didn‚Äôt have time to fully tune properly in which case people start clamoring for it to be tossed in the bonfire never to be seen again which is really frustrating because most things I know can be tuned to a level that‚Äôs fun to play as and against to a reasonable degree. Obviously there are some things that are too ridiculous for what we‚Äôre trying to be now and I have no attachment to keeping stuff like that, but seeing some people clamoring for stripping away actually interesting tools for the sake of ‚Äúlol remove gimmick‚Äù (to a certain extent this is obviously hyperbole) kinda pisses me off without valid discussion around why it‚Äôs unhealthy in ANY form at a purely fundamental level without considering other balancing factors such as how accessible it is, the potency it has when it actually hits, etc. This is the biggest reason that recently while I‚Äôve been giving new tools to characters I‚Äôve been posting in the channels, specifically to spark discussion so that things can be in a reasonable state before they hit an actual build.As far as some things feeling ‚Äòtacked on‚Äô this is more along the lines of things being added long ago without proper compensation in other areas the character‚Äôs kit before it reaches a build simply because again there‚Äôs 90 characters in this game and for the longest time I was the only one making changes to them for the most part. Back in HDR‚Äôs infancy I frequently got bored of tuning one character for so long and thus I moved on to making other characters have interesting stuff, but that‚Äôs not to say that any character‚Äôs current combination of tools and attributes is final. After three years of this I can generally tell when things are absurdly broken or feel stapled on and most of the time when that‚Äôs the case it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs unfinished in one way or another like 80% of EVERYTHING here.We want this game to be FUN.This is moreso surrounding discussion of redesigns and I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs been a lot of discussion on that front but I do want to be careful not to strip away a character‚Äôs identity unless it‚Äôs been actively proven or there‚Äôs concrete evidence that the identity or the tools they have are too toxic for this game.There‚Äôs no reason to remove fun and interesting options before at least attempting to actively retune them down to a reasonable level because then you both alienate your players and give the character less of a reason to be played at all which is the exact opposite of what we want.The whole point of HDR is to give everyone unique and fun tools that fit their archetype (and change their archetype to be more interesting where desired). No reason to completely kneecap a toolkit without due reason.Finally, remember, we are a small dev team with a giant cast of characters. Before voicing your complaints or raging about the state of this game please keep both this in mind and the fact that we‚Äôre nowhere even close to being finished with the state of this game. Both Rome and PM weren‚Äôt built in a day, and expecting a project this massive to be even near close to the polish that some of the longer standing mods for older games are, especially considering both the scope of this project as well as the decades of work that have been put into those other projects, is unreasonable even after three years of HDR development especially with a fluctuating and small dev team such as ours. Combine that with the fact that this game is humongous in scale, and that Ult is a brand new game with much less time to develop modding capacity and capabilities for compared to Brawl or Smash 4, and we‚Äôve got a steep mountain range to climb. Don‚Äôt be afraid to voice your concerns, but be patient with us. We are human, and saying our game is absolute garbage directly to our faces does in fact hurt, especially when this project is done completely for free as volunteer work and it‚Äôs the kind of stuff that makes us want to just up and leave. Keep in mind that we‚Äôre students/engineers and we have plenty of better things to do with our time than sit at our computers and slave over a project for ingrates who don‚Äôt fully appreciate the amount of effort that goes in. Of course not everyone here is ungrateful, there‚Äôs been a ton of support, but extreme negativity is very much unpleasant to see, and it helps nothing. You can absolutely criticize the current product, that‚Äôs how we grow and improve, but keep in mind when forming your feedback that we are human and we could stop development at any time should we so choose if we‚Äôre not having fun anymore. It‚Äôs okay to be frustrated with the game and speak up, it‚Äôs not okay to insult us or the work we‚Äôve done. Give things an honest chance before turning around and dismissing the changes we‚Äôve made. Once you do, we‚Äôre all ears because you‚Äôve got the hard evidence to back up your claims from your own playtime and experience within HDR itself.If your character hasn‚Äôt gotten the attention they need yet, don‚Äôt fret. They‚Äôre coming. Feel free to voice your concerns and anything you find that needs addressing but don‚Äôt bother us about the same issues constantly just because we haven‚Äôt looked at your character specifically just yet. There‚Äôs less than five people adjusting a roster of 90 characters (though that is slowly improving thanks to our new contributors!), and so some are going to have to wait longer than others as a sheer inevitable fact. However, we are slowly getting there, and as our infrastructure improves and our team grows it will only go up from here.Final RemarksAs always, remember that this project is first and foremost supposed to be fun. Fun for the players, fun for the community, fun for the contributors, and fun for the devs. Our definition of fun involves a certain level of balance and power levels that are reasonable. We know that a lot of this project does not currently meet our own expectations to the fullest yet, but there is only so much that can be done at once. So, sit back, have patience, and enjoy the ride.If you have the skills to make serious contributions, get involved with contributing! Fix some bugs! Look at our open issues and help resolve them. If you don‚Äôt want to contribute code fixes, you can still help! In the near future keep your eyes and ears out for more information for getting involved with testing. We love when people test Pull Request builds before we merge them, so that we can be sure that they work as expected and as written. We love when people play the nightlies and give early feedback. All of these things help us put out better betas with less issues overall. Problems that get found during nightly or, even better, during a PR, make a huge difference. Since one of the updates to the launcher makes it easy as pie to switch between beta and nightly, take the opportunity to play some cutting edge features between now and the next beta! If you have any issues, as always feel free to reach out for help and support from the commiunity.

There are a lot more changes in here than you would probably expect, so read on! First we have a high level overview of the major new changes, and then after that we have the development commentary and news.Whats new?A full changelog should be posted in the coming days, but in the mean time here‚Äôs a high level view of what‚Äôs new.Big new stuff: We have a launcher/updater now! See the launcher section below where we talk about it! The goal is to make hdr updates as fast and seamless as possible. This is just the first version (though we have tested it a lot ourselves), so there may be some hiccups here and there. A whole new stage select screen, courtesy of JoBen‚Äôs hard work! This has been in the works for a while, and now its finally here! A new arena UI, courtesy of Kalomaze! prcxml! Our params files are now all stored as .prcxml files in our /ultimate/mods/hdr folder. These can be edited much more easily because of this, and public contributors can finally make pull requests and contributions that change params! Packaging improvements! Our automatic packaging infrastructure now creates full installations of HDR automatically. The switch-package.zip on our Releases page contains everything you need besides atmosphere. If you have a modded switch (IE, you have atmosphere), extracting that zip to the root of your SD is all you need to install HDR. Alternatively, you can use our awesome launcher‚Äôs Install button, and the launcher will install HDR for you! As a result of packaging updates, this beta does not come with a dedicated ryujinx installation zip. This is something we care about, and we will be finding time to add dedicated ryujinx installation folders in the near future, probably by next beta. However, we are told that you can potentially extract all of the normal switch package to the sdcard folder in Ryujinx and it will ‚Äújust work.‚ÄùEngine Jab locks now function similarly to PM. Your tech option is locked in the moment you get jab locked. Double traction was fixed in this beta, so characters should not feel as slippery in states where they shouldn‚Äôt be. Ledge occupancy was fixed! In the last beta, performing ledge actions didn‚Äôt actually hold ledge occupied. Now, ledge actions will actually continue to occupy ledge, but this time only for 75% of the animation‚Äôs length. Parry window was reduced from 5f to 3f Drift DI was reduced at combo kb levels, to make followups more consistent at low knockbackCharacter changes Marth This guy was an atrocity! We spent a bunch of time in a call a few days ago to straighten him out. Some of his hitboxes were made smaller, and some of his moves, such as fair and uair and utilt, had their active frames reduced to be more reasonable. Additionally, the vfx were updated to more appropriately convey where his hitboxes are actually placed. Additionally, all of his tipper hitboxes were adjusted to be more consistently placed between moves. Details can be found here, as well as in the eventual full changelog. Falco Falco had a fair few changes as well! Most of the Falco work this time around was contributed by TeamPear! The biggest change is his dair being reworked. As it turns out, his HDR dair stronger, faster, laster longer, and had less endlag than melee dair by about 25% across the board! After the changes, the move is overall more like a nerfed ntsc dair, but with less endlag overall and more reasonable active frames. Duck Hunt This character had a few nice changes this time around as well! The changes for this character were contributed by Sejong, and among a few other things, its biggest change was in making gunman a move which has a gimmick timer (meaning you cannot use it until 10-15 seconds until you last used it), and the gunman firing is now triggered with a down special input while the gunman is out. Palutena If you know, you know. Palutena‚Äôs wall was really something else. We had reports of matches against Palu going practically to timeout consistently, and this was one of the most complained about moves we‚Äôve seen in a while. There were a fair few changes made to this move to make it a lot more reasonable to deal with, and you can read the details here. This change (though relatively simple) is funny enough that we felt it necessary to include it here. If you pummel with wario, a coin vfx and sfx is played, ala Mario up special. This minor change was contributed by Spawn_32. Other minor changes Many other minor changes and fixes were made to various characters, which you‚Äôll want to stay tuned for an updated changelog for. Or, go try them yourself! The overall list of changes is available (at the high level) on the Releases page New ContributorsThis time around, we‚Äôve had some new contributors joining the contributor list! Our development process has been improving as always, and more people are slowly learning how to make moveset changes and help contribute bugfixes. If you want to get more involved with this, we still intend to write a more comprehensive contributing guide at some point. Also, in the near-ish future, Techy intends to host a sort of contributing workshop where we work through the process from start to finish on stream of setting up a fresh pc, to having made a public contribution/fix to HDR, so stay tuned for that.We would love it if our contributors who have a different github username than on discord would please add their github username to their server nickname, such as @techy (techyCoder81).

Thanks for joining us for our first official public beta! It‚Äôs a bit sooner than we‚Äôd like, but the beans have been boiling for much too long and we‚Äôd like to get them off the stove since it‚Äôs about time we served them up. On that note, we‚Äôd like to offer a few comments regarding the current state of the build.ChangesThere are SOO MANY changes since the last time you all have played, and even more for those who are coming from Ultimate! We are working on a complete changelog, but that might take a few more hours or even days, in the meantime we hope you all can enjoy.While you all wait for some character-specific changes, here are some global changes that you all should know about! UI overhaul: Most of the game‚Äôs UI has been replaced by new, HDR exclusive UI Massive stage changes: Huge thanks to Devory, Ginn, and Angst for assisting us in curating a massive selection of stages which now have legal layouts and pseudo-legal layouts! Major engine overhaul: Airdodges that stall your momentum (not refreshed on hit/once per airtime) Completely linear knockback/hitstun Drift DI Hitstun canceling is gone Grounded movement nearly identical to melee, including dash dancing, moonwalking, stickywalking, and boost running. Salty Runback Digital trigger presses for GameCube controllers function as a full analog press A new tag gamemode!ReorganizationHewDraw Remix is now officially open source, you can find our source code and repository here. We‚Äôve been working on restructuring our project to make new contributions easier for those who want, and also to allow us to better organize and be transparent with the community.We are open to contributions from the community that meet our standards, as well as community testing. You can test and fix bugs and issues we post here, help debug and test PRs for features and bugfixes as they have builds attached to them for easy access, and even PR changes and additions yourself to submit for review! If you want to test the latest WIP changes, we have nightlies built every day for access to the latest complete development. We‚Äôd love to see your input.If you have expertise in programming, modeling, animating, stage editing, or any other asset creation and are interested in becoming an official developer, feel free to reach out!Don‚Äôt worry, there will always be some surprises in the works, but now you can all see what we are doing and where. We also hope this to be a big educational resource for those who are wanting to get into Smash Ultimate modding and hope to see lots of new faces!Stay tuned for more information about how to contribute!State of the GameWritten by Black CalculusWe are a relatively small team working on this as a hobby project, and balancing and reworking a roster of 89 characters and a game engine this massive is no small feat.Firstly, you may notice upon playing with the build that there‚Äôs a bit of disparity as far as how finished every character feels, as well as some gaps in power level among the roster. Some of the cast is in a pretty crazy state right now, and others a bit underwhelming potency-wise. Regardless, we‚Äôve done our best to prioritize making both the engine and every character feel as fun and unique as we can, so you can thoroughly enjoy what you can currently get your hands on while we polish up some of the things that need more attention with coming updates. Rest assured that we will be addressing the problems strewn throughout the cast and the rest of the game in due time.For those of you that have been with us for a while, since the alpha stages:Normally we balance characters with regular playtesting both irl and online with you all but this batch of changes hasn‚Äôt seen much of that as we haven‚Äôt been able to be as active due to irl obligations, so some changes may seem or feel a bit disjointed from how each character plays or needs (aside from specific in-progress reworks). Combined with the new engine things may take a bit to get used to, so we urge you to play with the changes for at least a week to get a feel for your character‚Äôs changes in the context of the new game and give critiques of these changes and what you‚Äôd like to see altered/reverted/further changed after having had some time with them.Certain characters are not going to get off scott free and their tuning down of power level will not be changed, but we are not opposed to bringing them down to a more reasonable level in ways that suit the character better from a fun/feel perspective if the targeted changes this patch were misplaced.Finally‚Ä¶Please do not hesitate to ask questions about changes, character design, etc. as we‚Äôd like a dialogue with those of you who are able to have their hands on the game more consistently than us devs and have an active perspective on the characters you play." } ]
