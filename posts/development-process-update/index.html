It will be an opt-in early access build where players can test beta-ready changes and find issues in polish and balance. We will use feedback from large-scale testing to make adjustments and post subsequent pre-releases, until we’re finally happy with the changes and ready for a full beta release. To accompany beta pre-release builds, development-team changes will become private until each pre-release.
